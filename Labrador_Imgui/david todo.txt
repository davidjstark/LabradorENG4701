Test signal oscilloscope output and signal generator output against scopy/oscilloscope to make sure it is accurate
Create UI for Oscilloscope controls widget
Implement features from Oscilloscope controls widget
Make triggering level appear as a line when changed
Calculate frequency of signal
Auto triggering level
Allow Greek characters (mu)
Create overload for renderSliderwUnits so we can input different min and maxes for different units
rendersliderwunits seems buggy to me for the oscilloscope widget. It drags 2 at a time for some reason.
